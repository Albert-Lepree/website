<h2 class="Abt">About Me</h2>
    
    
<p style="font-size: 200%">My name is Albert Finnegan LePree, I am currently a software engineering major at Florida Gulf Coast University. I want to eventually start a skateboard company called: "Brackish Boards." After Collge I plan on moving to New York to attend New York University for film studies, because my favorite director (Sam Esmail) attended the same college. I decided to study software engineering after watching Sam's show: "Mr.Robot." I was already very much into computers but that show made me more passionate about software in general.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 200%">In my Free time I like to skateboard, play videogames, play hockey, watch movies, spend time with family, draw, and eat mexican food.</p>
